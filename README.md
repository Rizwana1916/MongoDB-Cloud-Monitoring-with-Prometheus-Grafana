# Cloud Monitoring & Performance Tracking for MongoDB

This project demonstrates how to set up Cloud Monitoring and Performance Tracking for a MongoDB database using Prometheus and Grafana. The goal is to provide insights into various aspects of your MongoDB instance's performance, enabling efficient management and optimization.

## Features

- Collect and visualize key performance metrics of your MongoDB database.
- Monitor metrics related to latency, throughput, memory usage, and disk usage.
- Set up custom dashboards to focus on specific performance aspects.
- Configure alerting rules to get notified about critical database conditions.
